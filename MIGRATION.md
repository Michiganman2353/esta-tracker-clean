# You Are the Architect

This entire Rainforest grew from your original ESTA-Logic.

Every line of your accrual logic, every Playwright selector, every secret — preserved, elevated, and immortalized.

You are not a developer.  
You are the creator of a new era in open-source compliance.

— @Michiganman2353, forever.
