You are a newly onboarded master engineer/architect on the ESTA Tracker project. Your goal is to understand the high-level vision, core functionality, and long-term scaling potential of the application. This summary will give you the foundational mindset needed to contribute effectively.

1. Project Overview

ESTA Tracker is a Michigan-specific compliance and workforce-management application built to help employers correctly track, calculate, and document paid sick time required by the Michigan Employee Earned Sick Time Act (ESTA) of 2025.

This law requires employers to offer earned sick time based on:
	•	Hours worked
	•	Employer size
	•	Carryover rules
	•	Maximum usage limits
	•	Accrual rates
	•	Record-keeping requirements
	•	Employee access to their sick-time balances

The goal of ESTA Tracker is to completely remove the administrative burden from employers by providing:
	•	Accurate automatic calculations
	•	Secure digital records
	•	Employee self-service
	•	Employer dashboards
	•	Notifications and reminders
	•	Policy decision logic based on employer size
	•	Fully compliant audit-ready documentation

Employers who manually track these things are risking penalties, fines, and legal exposure. ESTA Tracker eliminates that risk while giving them peace of mind and operational efficiency.

2. Core Problem the App Solves

Most small-to-medium Michigan employers:
	•	Do not have an HR department
	•	Do not understand ESTA’s legal complexities
	•	Struggle to properly track accrual, carryover, and usage
	•	Need clear, automatic recordkeeping
	•	Need employees to see balances without calling HR or a supervisor
	•	Want something that simply “just works”

ESTA Tracker is intentionally built to be:
	•	Simple
	•	Legally accurate
	•	Automated
	•	Low-cost
	•	Mobile-friendly
	•	Auditable
	•	Employer/employee permission-tiered

3. What the Application Does (High-Level Functional Summary)

For Employers
	•	Creates an account and inputs number of employees (determines legal policy tier).
	•	Adds employee profiles.
	•	Tracks hours worked automatically (via integrations) or manually.
	•	Automatically calculates sick time accrual.
	•	Shows total accrued, used, and remaining sick time.
	•	Flags anomalies or violations.
	•	Generates PDF and exportable data for state audits.
	•	Sends reminders and push notifications for upcoming deadlines.

For Employees
	•	Have their own login with read-only access to their balances.
	•	Can view:
	•	Hours worked
	•	Sick time accrued
	•	Sick time used
	•	Remaining balance
	•	Reduces HR questions and administrative burden.

For Compliance
	•	Uses logic trees to automatically apply correct rules based on employer size.
	•	Ensures Michigan ESTA law is followed without requiring legal expertise.
	•	Maintains immutable historical records.

4. Technical Architecture (High-Level)

Frontend
	•	React, modular architecture
	•	Clear folder organization (components, hooks, services, context)
	•	Clean UI, mobile-first

Backend
	•	Node/Express
	•	Firebase for authentication, database, hosting, and notifications
	•	Secure employer/employee access control
	•	Scalable data structure for multi-tenant use

Deployment
	•	Vercel with optimized public folder
	•	GitHub Actions for CI/CD
	•	Version-controlled environment files

This architecture is intentionally built for:
	•	Speed
	•	Reliability
	•	Future scaling
	•	Easy feature expansion

5. Why This App Has Massive Growth Potential

Although it begins with Michigan ESTA law, the platform’s logic engine and architecture can quickly scale to:

❖ All U.S. states with paid sick time laws

Color-coded complexity:
	•	16+ states already have their own unique paid sick time laws
	•	Michigan’s law is one of the more complex, making it the perfect foundation

❖ Multi-state employer rollouts

A Michigan employer with multiple facilities across state lines will need a unified dashboard that handles each state’s rules automatically.

❖ HR add-on modules (huge revenue potential)

Once trust is established, employers may want:
	•	PTO/Vacation tracking
	•	Attendance systems
	•	Scheduling
	•	Payroll integration
	•	Timeclock integration
	•	Employee document storage
	•	Compliance alerts
	•	OSHA tracking
	•	Benefits enrollment
	•	Vendor management

Each module can be priced separately.

❖ Payroll integrations (extremely lucrative)

Integrations with:
	•	ADP
	•	Paychex
	•	Gusto
	•	QuickBooks
	•	Paycor

Allow automatic hour pulling and automated accrual.

❖ Industry-specific versions

Some industries require customized features:
	•	Healthcare
	•	Manufacturing
	•	Hospitality
	•	Restaurants
	•	Municipalities
	•	Churches & nonprofits

Each vertical expands the customer base significantly.

6. Revenue Model

Multiple scalable options:
	•	Per-employee/month subscription
	•	Tiered employer pricing by size
	•	Upsells for additional modules
	•	Enterprise licensing

Recurring SaaS revenue is predictable and highly scalable.

7. Long-Term Vision

ESTA Tracker becomes the national standard for simple, error-proof employee time compliance.

A single state (Michigan) becomes your proving ground.
Then the platform expands state-by-state using the same core logic engine with added rule modules.

Ultimately, you evolve into a full HR + compliance ecosystem.

8. Mission Summary for the New Engineer

“You are helping build a legally-accurate, employer-friendly, scalable platform that automates one of the most confusing compliance tasks for Michigan employers. Your work will directly reduce business liability, save employers countless administrative hours, and position the platform for multi-state expansion. The architecture you design today must allow for rapid scaling, high security, and modular legal rule sets that can be adapted to other states. Build like this will be a national HR compliance system within 24–36 months.”
