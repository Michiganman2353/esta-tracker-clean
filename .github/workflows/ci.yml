  # Production deployment for master branch
  # IMPORTANT: This job uses GitHub Secrets to securely store the Vercel authentication token.
  # The VERCEL secret is referenced via ${{ secrets.VERCEL }} and is never exposed in code.
  # 
  # SECURITY NOTE: Secrets must be configured in GitHub repository settings under
  # Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions before this workflow can succeed.
  # 
  # SETUP VERIFICATION: This deployment step should NOT be considered complete until:
  # 1. The VERCEL secret is properly configured in GitHub repository settings
  # 2. The VERCEL_ORG_ID secret is properly configured
  # 3. The VERCEL_PROJECT_ID secret is properly configured
  # 4. A successful deployment has been verified in your CI/CD pipeline
  # 5. The deployment is confirmed working in the Vercel dashboard
  #
  # Never commit tokens directly to source code. Always use GitHub Secrets.
