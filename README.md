## <span style="color:#007BFF;">SECTION 1: VISION & PURPOSE 💡</span>

**<span style="color:#28A745;">Ignite Growth: Turn Compliance into a Competitive Edge!</span>**  

ESTA Tracker is a full stack SaaS platform designed to automate compliance with the Michigan Earned Sick Time Act (2025). It empowers small and medium sized businesses - especially those with no HR department - to remain compliant, track employee accruals, manage PTO requests, automate documentation, and reduce legal risk.

The platform acts as a turnkey HR compliance engine: tracking hours, generating audit logs, notifying administrators of issues, integrating with payroll, and maintaining full legal adherence.

**<span style="color:#FFC107;">Long term vision:</span>**  
- **<span style="color:#DC3545;">Become the national standard tool</span>** for state specific HR compliance.  
- **<span style="color:#DC3545;">Expand to other states</span>** as laws evolve.  
- **<span style="color:#DC3545;">Integrate deeply</span>** with major payroll providers.  
- **<span style="color:#DC3545;">Provide AI powered HR assistance</span>** for small businesses.

## 🔐 Security: Google Cloud KMS Integration

ESTA Tracker uses **Google Cloud Key Management Service (KMS)** for enterprise-grade encryption:

### Why KMS?

- ✅ **Hardware-backed security** - Keys stored in Google's HSMs
- ✅ **Automatic key rotation** - Configurable rotation schedules
- ✅ **Audit logging** - Complete access history
- ✅ **Compliance ready** - FIPS 140-2, HIPAA, SOC 2
- ✅ **Never exposed** - Private keys never leave Google infrastructure

### Encryption Architecture

```
Data → AES-256-GCM Encryption → Encrypted Data
          ↓
    Random AES Key
          ↓
   KMS Public Key → Encrypted AES Key
```

### Quick Setup

```bash
# 1. Enable KMS API
gcloud services enable cloudkms.googleapis.com

# 2. Run setup script
npm run setup:kms

# 3. Configure environment
export GCP_PROJECT_ID="esta-tracker"
export KMS_LOCATION="us-central1"
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="path/to/key.json"
```

### Usage

```typescript
import { encryptWithKMS, decryptWithKMS } from './services/kmsHybridEncryption';

// Encrypt sensitive data
const encrypted = await encryptWithKMS('SSN: 123-45-6789');

// Decrypt when needed
const decrypted = await decryptWithKMS(encrypted);
```

### What Gets Encrypted

✅ **Always encrypted:**
- Social Security Numbers (SSN)
- Tax IDs (EIN)
- Bank account numbers
- Medical information
- Salary data

❌ **Not encrypted:**
- Employee names (for search)
- Email addresses (for auth)
- Company names (for display)
- Timestamps

📚 **Full Documentation:** See [KMS_SETUP_GUIDE.md](./KMS_SETUP_GUIDE.md)
